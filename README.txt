What is it?
What Are You Eating, or WAYE is intended to be a resource for those who are curious about the ingredients in the food that they eat.
WAYE utilizes OCR in order to parse ingredient labels and combines this with the knowledge of large language models in order to provide easy-to-undertand information about
the health impacts of foods.

Why did we make this?
Processed foods are an inevitable part of modern life, and we believe that everyone should have accurate information regarding the foods that they eat. For those with allergies,
scanning ingredients labels can be frustrating. Our tool makes the process of determining potential allergens easy.


Technologies used:
We used React Native and Javascript Express, as well as OpenAI's API to create WAYE's interface.
